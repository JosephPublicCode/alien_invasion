- allow the ship to move up and down as well as left and right. 
- left side shooter game
- star class or other objects
- sideways shooter
- p button to play the game
- buttons that apply different levels of difficulty
- multiple hits at once does not lead to multiple score increments

1. ship can move up and down as well
2. alien kill count
3. as you kill aliens they speed up. 
4. aliens shoot bullets and sound effects.
